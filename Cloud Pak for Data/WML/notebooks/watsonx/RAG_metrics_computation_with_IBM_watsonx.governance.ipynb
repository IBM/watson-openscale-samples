    "# Metrics computation using IBM watsonx.governance for RAG task\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is used to compute reference free Answer Quality metrics such as **Faithfulness**, **Answer relevance** and **Unsuccessful requests** for RAG task type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Faithfulness** measures how faithful the model output or generated text is to the context sent to the LLM input. The faithfulness score is a value between 0 and 1. A value closer to 1 indicates that the output is more faithful or grounded and less hallucinated. A value closer to 0 indicates that the output is less faithful or grounded and more hallucinated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer relevance** measures how relevant the answer or generated text is to the question. This is one of the ways to determine the quality of your model. The answer relevance score is a value between 0 and 1. A value closer to 1 indicates that the answer is more relevant to the given question. A value closer to 0 indicates that the answer is less relevant to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsuccessful requests** measures the ratio of questions answered unsuccessfully out of to the total number of questions. The unsuccessful requests score is a value between 0 and 1. A value closer to 0 indicates that the model is successfully answering the questions. A value closer to 1 indicates the model is not able to answer the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**: The user needs to provide a data frame which contains question, context and the model generated response for each question to compute reference free metrics and include reference answer to compute the reference based metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please run the notebook in an environment with memory greater than 6GB**\n"

Having a very low value might lead to increase in metric computation time and attributions not capturing the all the aspects of the answer. | 2 |  |\n",
