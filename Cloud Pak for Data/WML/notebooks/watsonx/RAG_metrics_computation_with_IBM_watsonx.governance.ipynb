These grouped sentences will be shown in the attributions. Having a very high value of ngrams might lead to having lower faithfulness scores due to dispersion of data and inclusion of unrelated sentences in the attributions. Having a very low value might lead to increase in metric computation time and attributions not capturing the all the aspects of the answer. | 2 |  |\n","| sample_size [Optional]| The faithfulness metric is computed for a maximum of 50 LLM responses.
