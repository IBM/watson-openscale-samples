What is the origin of IBM’s “THINK” motto?,"In December 1911, when future IBM Chairman Thomas J. Watson, Sr., managed the sales and advertising departments of the National Cash Register Company, he is reported to have said at a sales meeting: “The trouble with everyone of us is that we don’t think enough. We don’t get paid for working with our feet; we get paid for working with our heads. ...

And Watson brought that concept with him when he later joined the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (C-T-R) — the forerunner of today’s IBM — as general manager in 1914.  “THINK” appeared in C-T-R in the form of a large block-letter sign, famed and placed in offices and plants, and was printed in company publications. In the early 1930s — thanks to the process of plastic lamination which facilitated large-scale production and distribution — the THINK motto began to take precedence over other slogans', 'with all that business expansion and spreading international presence, the greatest period of IBM’s growth still lie ahead.    Q. What is the origin of the term “wild ducks” in IBM history and culture?  A. Your question is best answered by the words of former IBM Chairman Thomas J.

Information on that topic is posted on our Documents Desk available at  http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/documents/index.html   Q. What were some of the milestone’s of IBM’s business outside the United States?  A. The following is a year-by-year compilation of some key events in IBM’s operations outside the United States:   1914 – A branch of the International Time Recording Company, an IBM forerunner, is opens in France (possibly the first non-U.S. operation business other than Canada).   1915 – The Canadian business reaches about $30,000, with a sales force of 12.   1917 – International Business Machines Co., Ltd., is organized to conduct business in Canada.  This is merely a consolidation of three subsidiaries of the three parent companies   1917 – An office opens in Brazil.   1919 – IBM is introduced into Europe.    1920 – Thomas J. Watson sails for Bombay to open the first office in India.   1922 – A shipment of tabulating machines is sent to Sweden for the population census.   1922 – CTR machines are shown to public in Brazil for the first time at the Century of Independence Fair.   1923 – Sales posts are opened in Latin America and the Far East.   1924 – The Sindelfingen, Germany, plant is completed.   1925 – The Vincennes, France, plant is completed.   1925 – The first IBM tabulating equipment installed in Argentina by the government.   1925 – The first IBM machinery installed in Chile by the Chilean State Railways.   1925 – IBM enters the Philippines.', '9215FQ14 Predecessor Companies  Q.  When did IBM begin? I’ve heard various dates, such as 1911, 1914, 1924 — so what is the official date? When, for example, will IBM celebrate its centennial?  A.  Interestingly, a case can be made for any of the five following dates on which to base IBM’s anniversary:  September 30, 1889 — The incorporation of Bundy Manufacturing Co. (time recording equipment), the first of many components that eventually became the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, Inc. (C-T-R), and later IBM.  December 3, 1896 — Incorporation by Herman Hollerith of The Tabulating Machine Co. (punched card tabulating equipment), the part of C-T-R that eventually became IBM’s principal line of business.  June 16, 1911 — Incorporation of C-T-R, which had acquired Computing Scale Company of America, The Tabulating Machine Company, International Time Recording Company of New York, and the Bundy Manufacturing Company. Only the first three businesses were represented in the C-T-R name. There were also a number of other companies formed after 1889 which had been acquired by the various C-T-R units prior to 1911.  May 4, 1914 — Thomas J. Watson, Sr., was hired as C-T-R’s general manager. IBM has in the past traditionally recognized this date as its anniversary.  February 14, 1924 — The name of C-T-R was changed to International Business Machines Corporation, a name which actually had been registered in New York since 1918. The name was first used in 1917 when International Business Machines Company, Ltd., was established in Canada.  Notwithstanding the enormous leadership role Thomas Watson, Sr., played in guiding C-T-R to success and in the evolution of that company into the International Business Machines of today, IBM recognizes 1911 as the year in which the core predecessor businesses began operating as a unified corporation, and, accordingly, IBM will celebrate its centennial in 2011.   Q. What were the origins of IBM?  A. The earliest roots of IBM can be', '17  \n9215FQ14  1941 – The first IBM technical school in Latin America opens in Buenos Aires.   1943 – The first IBM equipment in Panama is installed in the offices of Contraloria   G e n e r a l .    1944 – The first IBM equipment in Costa Rica is installed in Caja del Seguro Social.   1945 – The first IBM machines are installed in El Salvador.   1946 – An IBM France office opens in Saigon, Vietnam.   1949 – The IBM World Trade Corporation is organized as an independent but wholly- owned subsidiary to handle operations outside the United States.   1950 – The first IBM machines in Israel are installed in the office of the Accountant   G e n e r a l .    1950 – The first Latin American Hundred Percent Club is held in Rio de Janeiro.   1950 – The first IBM machines are installed in Malagasy by the government.   1950 – The first IBM school for Africans opens in Leopoldville, Belgian Congo.   1951 – IBM China is confiscated by the Communist government.   1951 – IBM machines are installed in the Ivory Coast.   1953 – The first IBM machines are installed in Jamaica for its census.   1953 – Harrel Mallac becomes the first user of IBM machines in Mauritius.    1954 – The first IBM machines are installed in Singapore by Overseas Assurance.   1955 – The first IBM installation in Angola is made by Benguela Railways.  1956 – The first African Hundred Percent Club held in Johannesburg, South Africa.   1959 – The World Trade Corporation dedicates Blaricum (The Netherlands) education   c e n t e r .    1961 – IBM Cuba confiscated by the Castro government.

Originally designed to facilitate and control the clearing of checks in banks, the International Proof Machine later found new applications in other commercial and industrial accounting systems permitting vouchers, invoices and other commercial papers to be proved and distributed with amazing speed and accuracy.  IBM contributed to the field of education in 1937 with the announcement of the Test Scoring Machine which scored a complete examination in less time than it took to record the grade, and with far greater accuracy than a manual scorer.  Year after year, IBM produced constant improvements in electric accounting machines, including the development of automatic reproducing punches, summary card punches, multiplying punches, direct subtraction and accounting machines, and alphabetical equipment. The latter machines were capable of transcribing descriptive data in alphabetical form as well as the customary numerical total printing or detail listing.   During the little more than two decades after Thomas Watson had assumed the reins, IBM had grown from a $4 million business to a worldwide enterprise employing some 10,000 people, with more than $25 million in revenue. In the late-1930s, the company already owned and operated, directly or through subsidiaries, factories in ten cities in six countries (its principal plant at Endicott, N.Y.; a card-printing plant in Washington, D.C.; the Electric Writing Machine Factory at Rochester, N.Y.; and plants at Dayton, Ohio; Toronto, Canada; Hammersmith, near London, England; Berlin and Sindelfingen, Germany; Vincennes, near Paris, France; and Milan, Italy).

A certain amount of reprogramming had been necessary to use added core units providing additional memory. With System/360, limited storage capacity was no longer an obstacle to the maximum use of a computer. System/360 processors provided a central memory capacity of from 8,000 to 524,000 characters. Additional low-cost storage of up to eight million characters was available with any of the larger configurations.  With System/360, it was no longer necessary to match a user’s problem to a specific piece of equipment because of differences in machine design and problem-solving capacity. System/360’s units could be combined in an almost infinite variety of ways so that the system was literally tailored to a customer’s job.  The built-in communications capability of System/360 allowed the user to greatly increase the scope of computer usefulness. Up to 248 data transmission terminals could communicate with the computer simultaneously — even when it was busy on a batch processing job.  The System/360 also ended the distinction between commercial and scientific computers. Each System/360 processing unit had the ability to process work through small binary, decimal or floating point arithmetic centers. This meant that the same System/360 configuration could handle commercial work, scientific work or a combination of the two, with equal effectiveness.  The launch of the IBM System/360 was a significant event in the history of computing. For IBM, it was a staggering undertaking. The company spent three-quarters of a billion dollars just on engineering, and invested another $4.5 billion on factories, equipment and the rental machines themselves. IBM hired more than 60,000 new employees and opened five major new plants. Thomas J. Watson, Jr., called it “the biggest privately financed commercial project ever undertaken.” The timing of the launch, when not all of the new machines had', '9215FQ14 Q. What is the IBM AS/400?  A. When the Application System/400 (AS/400) was introduced in June 1988, it was the largest worldwide product announcement in IBM history. More than 100,000 customers, IBM business partners, consultants, analysts, vendors, reporters and IBM branch people in more than 140 locations were linked to the main product unveiling in New York City. Rolled out that day were six AS/400 models and more than 1,000 software packages. The AS/400 family at announcement offered a 10-fold performance range from the smallest to the largest model in the number of commercial transactions it could process per hour — up to 45,000 in IBM benchmark tests.    Among the product’s attributes cited by IBM at the time of its introduction were the AS/400’s integrated, state-of-the-art system; reliability; largest application library of any multi-user system in the industry; most productive system for developing applications in the industry; improved ease of use for both new and experienced users; unsurpassed connectivity with IBM systems, such as the System/370, System/36 and System/38; extremely fast processing (twice that of the high-end System/38 and five times that of the high-end System/36); adherence to IBM’s Systems Application Architecture; ability to provide a total office solution; electronic customer support and online education.
