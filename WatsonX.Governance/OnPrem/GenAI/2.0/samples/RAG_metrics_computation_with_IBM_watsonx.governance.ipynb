    "# Computing Answer Quality and Retrieval Quality Metrics using IBM watsonx.governance for RAG task\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the creation of a Retrieval Augumented Generation (RAG) pattern using watsonx.ai and computations of reference-free Answer Quality metrics, such as **Faithfulness**, **Answer relevance**, **Unsuccessful requests**, Content Analysis metrics such as **Coverage**, **Density**, **Abstractness** and Retrieval Quality Metrics such as **Context Relevance**, **Retrieval Precision**, **Average Precision**, **Reciprocal Rank**, **Hit Rate** and **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain** for the RAG task type. It also identifies the source attribution using watsonx.governance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faithfulness** measures how faithful the model output or generated text is to the context sent to the LLM input. The faithfulness score is a value between 0 and 1. A value closer to 1 indicates that the output is more faithful - or grounded - and less hallucinated. A value closer to 0 indicates that the output is less faithful and more hallucinated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer relevance** measures how relevant the answer or generated text is to the question. This is one of the ways to determine the quality of your model. The answer relevance score is a value between 0 and 1. A value closer to 1 indicates that the answer is more relevant to the given question. A value closer to 0 indicates that the answer is less relevant to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unsuccessful requests** measures the ratio of questions answered unsuccessfully out of the total number of questions. The unsuccessful requests score is a value between 0 and 1. A value closer to 0 indicates that the model is successfully answering the questions. A value closer to 1 indicates the model is not able to answer the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coverage** metric quantifies the extent to which the model output. It measures the percentage of output words that are also in the input text. The coverage score is a value between 0 and 1. A higher score close to 1 indicates that higher percentage of output words are within the input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Density** quantifies how well the summary or the answer in the model output can be described as a series of extractions from the model input or context. A lower value of density metric indicates that on average the extractive fragments do not closely resemble verbatim extractions from the original source or context text. Abstractive summarization involves generating new, concise sentences that convey the main ideas of the source text but may not be directly copied from it. This is in contrast to extractive summarization, where the summary consists mainly of sentences directly lifted from the source. The lower the score the more abstractive the model output is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstractness** measures the abstractness of the model generated text by measuring the new n-grams generated in the model output compared to the model input. The metric computes the ratio of n-grams in the generated text that do not appear in the source content or context send to the model. The abstractness score is a value between 0 and 1. A higher score close to 1 indicates high abstractness in the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Relevance** assesses the degree to which the retrieved context is relevant to the question sent to the LLM. This is one of the ways to determine the quality of your retrieval system. The context relevance score is a value between 0 and 1. A value closer to 1 indicates that the context is more relevant to your question in the prompt. A value closer to 0 indicates that the context is less relevant to your question in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieval Precision** measures the quantity of relevant contexts from the total contexts retrieved. The retrieval precision is a value between 0 and 1. A value of 1 indicates that all the retrieved contexts are relevant. A value of 0 indicates that none of the retrieved contexts are relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average Precision** evaluates whether all the relevant contexts are ranked higher or not. It is the mean of the precision scores of relevant contexts. The average precision is a value between 0 and 1. A value of 1 indicates that all the relevant contexts are ranked higher. A value of 0 indicates that none of the retrieved contexts are relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reciprocal Rank** is the reciprocal of the rank of the first relevant context. The retrieval reciprocal rank is a value between 0 and 1. A value of 1 indicates that the first relevant context is at first position. A value of 0 indicates that none of the relevant contexts are retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hit Rate** Hit Rate measures whether there is atleast one relevant context among the retrieved contexts. The hit rate value is either 0 or 1. A value of 1 indicates that there is at least one relevant context. A value of 0 indicates that there is no relevant context in the retrieved contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain** Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain or NDCG measures the ranking quality of the retrieved contexts. The ndcg is a value between 0 and 1. A value of 1 indicates that the retrieved contexts are ranked in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",

      "Question:What is ARPA-H?\n",
      " context:['Last month, I announced our plan to supercharge  \\nthe Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago. \\n\\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases.  \\n\\nMore support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror.', 'We’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.  \\n\\nWe’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.  \\n\\nAnd we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \\n\\nIf you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \\n\\nWe’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. \\n\\nAnd on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.   \\n\\nEven if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week.', 'For that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. \\n\\nAs I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power.  \\n\\nAnd we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days weeks, months, will be hard on them.  \\n\\nPutin has unleashed violence and chaos.  But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run. \\n\\nAnd a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.', 'If you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of land. \\n\\nIt won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built. \\n\\nThis is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor “mega site”. \\n\\nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs. \\n\\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives. \\n\\nSmartphones. The Internet. Technology we have yet to invent. \\n\\nBut that’s just the beginning. \\n\\nIntel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from  \\n$20 billion to $100 billion. \\n\\nThat would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history. \\n\\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill.']\n"
