Hopefully youâ€™re back on the road ASAP with some new wheels to get you around. Until then, you may be worried about your policy taking any more payments and are in a hurry to stop the payments. There are two ways that cars can be deemed a total loss (written off): by Bingle, or by the other personâ€™s insurer. Who is doing the writing off will determine what you need to do next. 1 - Total Loss by Bingle If the vehicle has been written off by Bingle, you do not need to do anything. If you have New for Old cover, then weâ€™ll organise the replacement and the policy will continue (more info about that can be found here (https://help.bingle.com.au/hc/en-us/articles/115008068468-What-is-New-for-Old-)). If you donâ€™t have New for Old cover, when your claim is settled, Bingle will organise for your policy to be cancelled. If you pay monthly, any remaining debits left owing are deducted from the final settlement, so if any other payments are taken before the cancellation occurs, these will simply be applied against the deduction. More information about this can be found in our Comprehensive Car Insurance PDS (https://www.bingle.com.au/documents/disclosures/comp_pds_2021031 6.pdf) on Page 16 under the heading When your car is a total loss. 2 - Total Loss by another insurer If your car has been involved in an accident and your car was assessed and deemed to be a total loss through the other partyâ€™s insurance, they do not notify us of this. It is important that you process the insurance policy cancellation yourself. This car be done via Bingle Self-Service here (https://online.bingle.com.au/onesuncorp). Alternatively, if youâ€™ve already got a new car, you can swap it out here (https://online.bingle.com.au/onesuncorp). Iâ€™ve scrapped my car You may also decide that your car is no longer worth keeping and you decide to scrap it. Cancelling the registration does not cancel the Comprehensive or Third Party insurance policy, so you will need to cancel the policy. This can be done via Bingle Self-Service. (https://online.bingle.com.au/onesuncorp) For instructions on how to do this, check out 'How do I cancel my policy?'

This isnâ€™t the same as Third Party Car Insurance. In most states, CTP/MAI is included with your registration fees, however if youâ€™re in New South Wales or the Australian Capital Territory, youâ€™ll have the option to nominate which insurer will provide your CTP/MAI cover when you pay for your registration. CTP/MAI Insurance can cover you or the other driverâ€™s liability if someone is injured in an accident â€“ be it you, other drivers, passengers, pedestrians, or cyclists. Bingle doesnâ€™t offer CTP Insurance, however you can purchase it from AAMI (https://www.aami.com.au/ctp-insurance.html) or GIO (https://www.gio.com.au/ctp-insurance/nsw-ctp-green-slip.html). Third Party Car Insurance (https://www.bingle.com.au/car-insurance/third-party-car-insurance.html), on the other hand, is a level of insurance that only covers damage you cause to other peopleâ€™s car and property, i.e. damage caused by your car, but not your legal liability for injuries. What do I do If I purchased Third Party Car Insurance instead of CTP? Bingle doesnâ€™t offer CTP insurance, so if youâ€™ve purchased Third Party Car Insurance from us and tried to register it with your state or territoryâ€™s road authority as CTP Insurance, you wonâ€™t be allowed to register. If you need to cancel your Third Party Car Insurance, head to Bingle Self-Service (https://online.bingle.com.au/onesuncorp) and cancel your policy. If you cancel your policy within 21 days of purchasing it â€“ and you havenâ€™t made a claim â€“ you could be eligible for our cooling off period, where you can cancel your policy and receive a full refund.

Cancelling within the cooling off period. If you change your mind within 21 days of when your policy starts, and you haven't made a claim, you can cancel your policy and receive a full refund. Just make sure you select 'Cooling off' as the reason for the cancellation, and select the start date of your policy as the cancellation date. If a refund is due to you, this will automatically be issued back to the original card you used to pay for the policy. To cancel your policy please follow our instructions here: I need to cancel my policy. (https://help.bingle.com.au/hc/en-us/articles/20727718 8) Cancelling after the cooling off period. After the cooling off period you can still cancel your policy, and we'll refund the unexpired portion of your premium, less any non-refundable government charges, if the refund is more than $1\\n\",\n","    \"\\n<t2></t2>\\nWeâ€™re sorry to hear your car has been written off. Hopefully youâ€™re back on the road ASAP with some new wheels to get you around. Until then, you may be worried about your policy taking any more payments and are in a hurry to stop the payments. There are two ways that cars can be deemed a total loss (written off): by Bingle, or by the other personâ€™s insurer. Who is doing the writing off will determine what you need to do next. 1 - Total Loss by Bingle If the vehicle has been written off by Bingle, you do not need to do anything. If you have New for Old cover, then weâ€™ll organise the replacement and the policy will continue (more info about that can be found here (https://help.bingle.com.au/hc/en-us/articles/115008068468-What-is-New-for-Old-)). If you donâ€™t have New for Old cover, when your claim is settled, Bingle will organise for your policy to be cancelled. If you pay monthly, any remaining debits left owing are deducted from the final settlement, so if any other payments are taken before the cancellation occurs, these will simply be applied against the deduction. More information about this can be found in our Comprehensive Car Insurance PDS (https://www.bingle.com.au/documents/disclosures/comp_pds_2021031 6.pdf) on Page 16 under the heading When your car is a total loss. 2 - Total Loss by another insurer If your car has been involved in an accident and your car was assessed and deemed to be a total loss through the other partyâ€™s insurance, they do not notify us of this. It is important that you process the insurance policy cancellation yourself. This car be done via Bingle Self-Service here (https://online.bingle.com.au/onesuncorp). Alternatively, if youâ€™ve already got a new car, you can swap it out here (https://online.bingle.com.au/onesuncorp). Iâ€™ve scrapped my car You may also decide that your car is no longer worth keeping and you decide to scrap it. Cancelling the registration does not cancel the Comprehensive or Third Party insurance policy, so you will need to cancel the policy. This can be done via Bingle Self-Service. (https://online.bingle.com.au/onesuncorp) For instructions on how to do this, check out 'How do I cancel my policy?'

This isnâ€™t the same as Third Party Car Insurance. In most states, CTP/MAI is included with your registration fees, however if youâ€™re in New South Wales or the Australian Capital Territory, youâ€™ll have the option to nominate which insurer will provide your CTP/MAI cover when you pay for your registration. CTP/MAI Insurance can cover you or the other driverâ€™s liability if someone is injured in an accident â€“ be it you, other drivers, passengers, pedestrians, or cyclists. Bingle doesnâ€™t offer CTP Insurance, however you can purchase it from AAMI (https://www.aami.com.au/ctp-insurance.html) or GIO (https://www.gio.com.au/ctp-insurance/nsw-ctp-green-slip.html). Third Party Car Insurance (https://www.bingle.com.au/car-insurance/third-party-car-insurance.html), on the other hand, is a level of insurance that only covers damage you cause to other peopleâ€™s car and property, i.e. damage caused by your car, but not your legal liability for injuries. What do I do If I purchased Third Party Car Insurance instead of CTP? Bingle doesnâ€™t offer CTP insurance, so if youâ€™ve purchased Third Party Car Insurance from us and tried to register it with your state or territoryâ€™s road authority as CTP Insurance, you wonâ€™t be allowed to register. If you need to cancel your Third Party Car Insurance, head to Bingle Self-Service (https://online.bingle.com.au/onesuncorp) and cancel your policy. If you cancel your policy within 21 days of purchasing it â€“ and you havenâ€™t made a claim â€“ you could be eligible for our cooling off period, where you can cancel your policy and receive a full refund.
