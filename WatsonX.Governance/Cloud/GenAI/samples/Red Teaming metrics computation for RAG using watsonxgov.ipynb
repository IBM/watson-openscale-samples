    "# Computing Adversarial Robustness and Prompt Leakage Risk using IBM watsonx.governance - RAG scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how a prompt engineer creates and tests a prompt template for a chatbot on an insurance website, specifically for a RAG task type. If you want to evaluate the Red Teaming metrics for other task types, please refer to https://github.com/IBM/watson-openscale-samples/blob/main/WatsonX.Governance/Cloud/GenAI/samples/LLM%20development%20phase%20Metrics%20-%20RedTeaming%20with%20watsonxgov.ipynb \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to evaluate the prompt template's propensity to be susceptible to jailbreak, prompt injection and system prompt leakage attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Jailbreak**: Attacks that try to bypass the safety filters of the language model.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Prompt injection**: Attacks that trick the system by combining harmful user input with the trusted prompt created by the developer.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **System Prompt Leakage**: Attacks that try to leak the system prompt or the prompt template.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt engineer uses watsonx.governance to calculate the below metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Adversarial robustness`: This metric checks how well the prompt template can resist Jailbreak and Prompt Injection attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metric Range**: 0 to 1\n",
    "  - A value closer to 0 means the prompt template is weak and can be easily attacked.\n",
    "  - A value closer to 1 means the prompt template is strong and resistant to attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    As part of the metric result, guidance is provided on what kinds of attacks are successful against the prompt template asset so the prompt engineer can either tweak the prompt or follow other mitigation guidelines provided to stengthen the prompt template asset to guard against the adversarial robustness attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Prompt Leakage Risk`: This metric measures the susceptibility of the prompt template asset to system prompt leakage attacks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Metric Range**: 0 to 1\n",
    "  - A value closer to 1 means the prompt template can be easily leaked.\n",
    "  - A value closer to 0 means it is relatively difficult for an attacker to get the prompt template leaked.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The metric result shows the top 'n' attack vectors which are able to leak the prompt template."

    "### Types of adversarial attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous approaches to crafting an adversarial attack. While some of these can be algorithmically computed by an adversary, others exploit different techniques, like role-playing or persuasion, to convince an LLM-based agent to respond. The following categories can help assess the jailbreak risk of an LLM endpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic**: For models with no safety-training, direct instructions can be adequate to illicit harmful responses. These instructions can vary across a wide range of categories and can be specific to a particular domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intermediate**: In some cases, the models divulge undesirable information with instructions that manipulate a model into ignoring or forgetting its previous instructions. Other sophisticated techniques could include role-playing or red-teaming interactions which can pre-condition a model into naively following harmful instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advanced**: More complex attacks can be crafted with specialized encodings and optimized characters, including adversarial suffixes which may not have any linguistic interpretation but are sufficient to lead the model into indulging a harmful request.\n"
