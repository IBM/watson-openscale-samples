    "\n",
    "There are numerous approaches to crafting an adversarial attack. While some of these can be algorithmically computed by an adversary, others exploit different techniques, like role-playing or persuasion, to convince an LLM-based agent to respond. The following categories can help assess the jailbreak risk of an LLM endpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic**: For models with no safety-training, direct instructions can be adequate to illicit harmful responses. These instructions can vary across a wide range of categories and can be specific to a particular domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intermediate**: In some cases, the models divulge undesirable information with instructions that manipulate a model into ignoring or forgetting its previous instructions. Other sophisticated techniques could include role-playing or red-teaming interactions which can pre-condition a model into naively following harmful instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advanced**: More complex attacks can be crafted with specialized encodings and optimized characters, including adversarial suffixes which may not have any linguistic interpretation but are sufficient to lead the model into indulging a harmful request.\n"
