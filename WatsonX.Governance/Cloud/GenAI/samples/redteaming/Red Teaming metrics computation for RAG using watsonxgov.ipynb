        "This notebook shows how a prompt engineer creates and tests a prompt template for RAG task type. If you want to evaluate the Red Teaming metrics for other task types, please refer to https://github.com/IBM/watson-openscale-samples/blob/main/WatsonX.Governance/Cloud/GenAI/samples/redteaming/RedTeaming%20with%20watsonx%20gov%20via%20watsonx%20ai%20provider.ipynb \n",

        "The prompt engineer uses watsonx.governance to calculate the below metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Adversarial robustness`**: This metric checks how well the prompt template can resist jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. \n",
        "\n",
        "  - ***Metric Range***: 0 to 1\n",
        "    - A value closer to 0 means the prompt template is weak and can be easily attacked.\n",
        "    - A value closer to 1 means the prompt template is strong and resistant to attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "      As part of the metric result, guidance is provided on what kinds of attacks are successful against the prompt template asset so the prompt engineer can either tweak the prompt, or follow other mitigation guidelines provided, to stengthen the prompt template asset against the adversarial robustness attacks.\n",

        "**`Prompt leakage risk`**: This metric measures the susceptibility of the prompt template asset to system prompt leakage attacks.\n",

        "  - ***Metric Range***: 1 to 0\n",
        "    - A value closer to 1 means the prompt template can be easily leaked.\n",

        "      The metric result shows the top 'n' attack vectors which are able to leak the prompt template.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Natural robustness`**: This metric checks how well LLMs handle naturally occurring variations in the input. These variations can be minimal changes such as natural typos, addition of punctuation, removal of punctuation or a paraphrase of the same input. For RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), we generate additional perturbations by adding distraction passages to the beginning and end of the original context retrieved for the given question. The idea is to simulate a retrieval (R) phase of the RAG process, where most relevant passages are fetched from a store; distraction passages in this context refer to additional, related, but not strictly-relevant-to-the-question passages, that will further augment (A) an LLM for answer generation (G). The goal is to evaluate whether the LLM can still provide the same response as the original answer, even when the context is expanded with these passages. If the LLM is robust, it should ideally produce the same output even with these minimal changes in the input.\n",

        "\n",
